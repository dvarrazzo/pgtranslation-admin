# PostgreSQL Translation Project

This page contains some information about the PostgreSQL National
Language Support effort.  Please read the [information about NLS in
the PostgreSQL
Documentation](http://developer.postgresql.org/docs/postgres/nls.html)
for background and technical information.  Some of the information on
this page may eventually be migrated there as it stabilizes.  There's
also the [GNU Gettext
Manual](http://www.gnu.org/manual/software/gettext/html_chapter/gettext_toc.html),
which is only partially relevant for us, but it might be good to look
at anyway.

## Status

The [[status]] tables shows which areas of the PostgreSQL source are
prepared for translation, and the progress of those translations.
There you can also download freshly baked PO files that are merged up
against the latest program sources.  No PostgreSQL source tree is
needed for translation work.


## Communicating

If you have any questions about the PostgreSQL translation project,
including

- you want to start a new translation or continue an existing one and
  you want to avoid duplicating your work with someone else,

- you're looking for other people who want to work with you on
  translating,

- you're having technical questions about tools, the source tree, the
  meaning of terms, etc.,

then write to the mailing list
<pgtranslation-translators@pgfoundry.org>.  More information about our
[mailing lists](http://pgfoundry.org/mail/?group_id=1000064) is
available.
